Files related to Android Apps as I learn how to create them.

My first project is to create a music theory app for guitar that can do the following:
- User chooses what chords they want to learn and the game:
  - Shows the guitar neck and either highlights notes and the user states the position: eg. user says if a note is a 3rd in the chord
- Shows a circle of fifths chart and does something similar where the user should state what chord in the chart is the 3rd
